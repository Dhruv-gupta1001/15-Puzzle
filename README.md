## Overview

[**15 puzzle**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) is a game which
consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile
missing. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using
as few moves as possible.

## Implementation

It is implemented as a **best-first search**. The solution to the problem
illustrates a general artificial intelligence methodology known as the
[**A* search algorithm**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
